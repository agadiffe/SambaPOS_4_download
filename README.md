# SambaPOS_4_download

https://sambapos.com/

SambaPOS company have decided to remove all V4 downloads from their website.
It would appear there is no longer any official download for V4.

I've dowloaded SambaPOS 4.1.82 from this website: https://sambapos.tricerolph.com/
But, as usual, they asked your name, your number, your email, etc ...  so boring, even if u can put false info ...

Found this site, on the offcial forum, here :
https://forum.sambapos.com/t/sambapos-v4-setup-file/16333

seem pretty boring to find that file, i hope google will do his job if you'r looking at it. :)


Here the SambaPOS 4.1.82 setup file.
